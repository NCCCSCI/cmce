For example, if there are three options for the same book, the most expensive is used in case that is the only item available.</li>\n<li>The tool tries to identify duplicate items. If there are two books, <em>The Instruction Book</em> and <em>Instruction Book</em>, the tool will consider them the same because the important words in the title are <em>Instruction</em> and <em>Book</em>. <em>Instruction Book</em> and <em>Book Instruction</em> are presumed to be different because the words are in a different order.</li>\n<li>The accuracy of the estimation will vary based on the materials - items such as clothing where multiple sizes are listed may not be accurately calculated.</li>\n<li>Items with the word <em>subscription</em> in the title will not be included in estimates because the student does not own them</li>\n<li>eBooks listed as <em>Web</em> are assumed to be <em>subscriptions</em> and are not included, unless no other materials are specified</li>\n<li>Materials listed as <em>Downloadable</em> are included as ownership is implied</li>\n<li>Include a disclaimer with the results, for example: <em>Be sure to check the bookstore site, and consult with the instructor for the class prior to registration.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="deltas">Deltas</h2>\n<p>The estimator includes a local store delta check.</p>\n<p>Each time the cost of materials is estimated, the costs are stored locally.
